If you're looking to see how this site was made;

- start with the `index.qmd` file. That's where the main page was created. 
- `_quarto.yml` collects all the individual files and builds them into a site along with a navigation bar.
- `styles.scss` contains all the css rules for the main page.
- see the `data` section in the site for instructions on the parallax effect (the treeline effect in the site header) and other effects in the website
