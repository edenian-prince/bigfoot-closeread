Quarto has made me enjoy writing documentation and that just feels wrong.

Aside from data stuff, I'm into reading (I love horror, history, politics, and anything else that is good), movies, hiking, language learning, and soccer. I have a mini microscope that I take with me on hikes so I can see the tiny world within our world.
I'm from Detroit, MI (go LIONS!!!!) and am living in Portland, OR.

Here's my [github profile](https://github.com/edenian-prince).
