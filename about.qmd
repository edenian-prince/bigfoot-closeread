## [Frank Aragona](https://github.com/edenian-prince)

**Epidemiologist, Data Engineer, Nerd**

Quarto has made me enjoy writing documentation and that just feels wrong.

<tr><td valign="top">

Aside from data stuff, I'm into reading (I love horror, history, politics, and anything else that is good), movies, hiking, language learning, and soccer. I have a mini microscope that I take with me on hikes so I can see the tiny world within our world.
I'm from Detroit, MI (go LIONS!!!!) and am living in Portland, OR.

Here's my [github profile](https://github.com/edenian-prince).

**Epidemiologist, Data Scientist, Bigfoot enthusiast**

Russ is a data scientist and epidemiologist currently at the Washington State Department of Health.

Russ was raised in the woods by hippies and wolves and as a result first met Uncle Bigfoot at a very young age. You can keep up with Russ's exploits, serious and unserious, on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rshean.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>. There may be some serious and useful open-source software and data visualization projects mixed in with the (also totally serious) stuff about bigfeets, UFOs, and the location of fire hydrants in Rhode Island.
