Sasquatch, most commonly spotted in the Pacific Northwest, is usually described as a bipedal ape-like creature, significantly larger than the average man, and completely covered in dark brown or reddish hair.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the scientific community remains skeptical and little evidence exists in support of a modern day Bigfoot, there are a lot of people out there who are confident that some sort of ape-man roams through the depths of North America’s most remote forests and devote their lives to finding them.”\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps you’d like to explore for yourself the places in Washington State where they’ve been spotted?\n\n\n\n\nClick on a sighting for more info\n\n\n\n\nChoose which variables you want to represent dot size and color\n\n\n\n\nSelect how you want to filter the sightings (at least one per subcategory!)\n\n\n\n\nHave fun!!!"
